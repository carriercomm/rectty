**rectty**

This is based off [ttyrec](http://0xcc.net/ttyrec). It will use [LeoNerd's fork of libvterm](https://launchpad.net/libvterm) to write a tty record with a seekable spec.

# Naming

I am aware "rectty", "playtty", et. al. is a stupid name for these tools. I am open to ideas for better names. Thank you!
